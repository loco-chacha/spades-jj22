    <h1>‚ô†Ô∏è 17 simple secrets to Spades, designed to help beginner and intermediate players raise their winning percentage</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <div class="h"><span class="num">1</span><span class="emoji">üßÆ</span>Before playing your first card of the hand, add up all the bids on the table to determine the total table bid.</div>
          <div class="small">
            a. If the total table bid is 12 or higher, play to take every trick you can until you have set your opponents.<br>
            b. If the table bid is 10 or lower, be selective in the tricks you take, there is not as much urgency to secure your bid. Save low cards to get out of the lead. Dump your mid-high cards under opponent‚Äôs tricks, not your lowest! Do not get carried away, opponents can still set you on a 10 bid and that is still a bad thing.<br>
            c. If the table bid is 11, do not avoid any tricks early, even if it means winning a trick you were not counting on taking. As the hand evolves, either make adjustments later for bag avoidance or play for extra tricks and try and set the opponents. Giving up tricks early in the hand with the plan to ‚Äúavoid bags‚Äù will often cause you to go set. Sometimes the Aces and Kings you based your bid on get taken from you later.
